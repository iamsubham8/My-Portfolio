        <h1>üé•Hand Gesture Media Control Using AI</h1>
        <img src="/Project Image/Game.png" alt="Media Control Image">
        <p>This game is built using JavaScript and allows the player to control a character using the arrow keys or the
            spacebar.
            The objective is to avoid oncoming obstacles by jumping over them. Each successful avoidance increases the
            player's score, which is displayed on the screen.
            The game features background music and sound effects to enhance the experience. If the player collides with
            an obstacle, the game ends, and the user must reload the page to restart.
        </p>

        <h2>üñêÔ∏èKey Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Character movement using arrow keys and spacebar.</li>
            <li>Real-time score tracking.</li>
            <li>Background music and sound effects</li>
            <li>Collision detection that ends the game</li>
            <li>Page reload to restart the game</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üíªTechnologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Basic DOM manipulation for character movement and score.</li>
            <li>Audio integration for background music and sound effects</li>
            <li>Pynput</li>
            <li>Collision detection logic</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üì±Functioning of Application</h2>
        <h3>User Interface</h3>
        <p>The game displays a character, obstacles, and a real-time score on the screen. 
        The background features dynamic elements and music to keep the player engaged.</p>

        <h3>User Input</h3>
        <p>Players use the arrow keys or spacebar to make the character jump and avoid obstacles. 
        Input detection listens for keydown events to trigger the jump animation.</p>

        <h3>Obstacle Movement</h3>
        <p>Obstacles continuously move toward the character, simulating a scrolling environment. 
            Their speed can increase over time to raise difficulty.</p>

        <h3>Collision Detection</h3>
        <p>The application continuously checks for collisions between the character and obstacles.
             If a collision is detected, the game ends immediately.</p>

        <h3>Score Tracking</h3>
        <p>For every successful avoidance (i.e., when an obstacle passes without a collision), the score increments. 
            The current score is displayed on the screen.</p>
        
         <h3>Audio Integration</h3>
        <p>Background music plays throughout the game, and sound effects trigger during key events 
            (e.g., jump, score increment, or collision)..</p>
        
         <h3>Game Over Logic</h3>
        <p>When a collision occurs, the game stops. The user must reload the page to restart, 
            providing a simple reset mechanism.</p>

        <h2>üì∫Outcomes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides an engaging and interactive experience where users can practice hand-eye coordination.</li>
            <li>Demonstrates real-time collision detection and dynamic gameplay.</li>
            <li>Incorporates background music and sound effects to enhance user immersion.</li>
            <li>Serves as a foundation for learning JavaScript game development, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game mechanics.</li>
            <li>Offers an accessible example of a browser-based game that can be extended or customized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üìùConclusion</h2>
        <p>The JavaScript Jump-and-Avoid Game successfully showcases the power of simple web technologies to create a fun and interactive user experience. 
            By combining keyboard input, real-time collision detection, and score tracking, the game delivers an engaging challenge that can be easily expanded with new features. 
            This project not only highlights the fundamentals of JavaScript programming but also serves as a stepping stone for aspiring developers interested in game development.</p>
