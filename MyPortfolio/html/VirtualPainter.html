    <img src="/Project Image/Painter.png" alt="Painter image">
    <p>The AI Virtual Painter is a cutting-edge software application that empowers users to craft digital artwork using intuitive hand gestures and computer vision—without 
      the need for a physical stylus or touchscreen. This system employs sophisticated computer vision techniques to recognize and interpret hand movements, enabling seamless and immersive painting experiences on a digital canvas.
    </p>

    <h2>🖌️Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>On-screen virtual canvas for painting and drawing</li>
      <li>Gesture-controlled brush strokes, enabling creative expression</li>
      <li>Real-time interaction with digital artwork</li>
      <li>Adjustable brush settings, including size, color, and style</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision)</li>
      <li>Hand Tracking Module (Custom or Mediapipe)</li>
      <li>Numpy</li>
      <li>Pynput (optional for keyboard/mouse input)</li>
      <li>Additional libraries (math, time, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🕹️How It Works</h2>
    <h3>User Interface</h3>
    <p>An interactive canvas that allows users to select colors, adjust brush settings, and create digital artwork.</p>

    <h3>Input Gesture</h3>
    <p>Users interact with the system using hand gestures, which are interpreted as brush strokes or other commands.</p>

    <h3>Hand Tracking</h3>
    <p>When users place their hands within the detection area, the system captures real-time positional and movement data from their hands and fingers.</p>

    <h3>Input Processing</h3>
    <p>The software analyzes the captured data to generate accurate drawing on the canvas.</p>

    <h3>Output Generation</h3>
    <p>Brush strokes are rendered in real-time, reflecting the user's artistic movements and preferences.</p>

    <h2>🏆Applications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hands-free digital painting</li>
      <li>Educational tools for art and design instruction</li>
      <li>Creative projects in gaming and virtual environments</li>
      <li>Assistive technology for individuals with mobility limitations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📝Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The AI Virtual Painter project highlights the potential of touchless, gesture-based creativity in
      the digital realm. It offers an innovative and accessible way for users to express their artistic visions,
      enhancing engagement and enabling new forms of interaction with digital devices. This technology not only
      streamlines the painting process but also opens doors to more inclusive and immersive creative experiences.
